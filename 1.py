f"""Write a fairy tale from the ${culture} (e.g. Japanese, Indian, Nordic, Celtic) culture about a ${main_character} (e.g. Hero, Villain, Dispatcher, Donor, Helper, Princess, False Hero) named ${name}, who lives in ${setting} (e.g. a big castle, an enchanted forest, a remote mountain village, middle-earth).

The story begins with the initial situation of the ${main_character}, where the ${main_character} is in a particular state (e.g. content, in need, unaware) within the ${setting}. The ${main_character} receives a warning or prohibition (e.g., the hero is told not to enter the dark forest), but this interdiction is violated, leading to a problem due to an act of villainy or a lack (e.g., an evil sorcerer kidnaps the princess, the kingdom is struck by famine), prompting the ${main_character} to embark on a quest (e.g., to rescue the princess from the sorcerer's clutches, to find a magical item that can save the land).

Along the way, the ${main_character} encounters a ${secondary_characters} (e.g., a Donor who provides a magical gift, a Helper who aids in the journey) that aids or challenges them in their quest. The ${main_character} faces several challenges (e.g., solving three riddles to pass through the enchanted forest, battling a fire-breathing dragon), and with the help of the ${secondary_characters}, the ${main_character} ultimately achieves victory (e.g., outsmarts the sorcerer and frees the princess, defeats the dragon and claims the treasure, breaks the curse and restores peace to the land).

The story concludes with the ${main_character}'s optional return to ${final_resolution} (e.g., the village where the hero and princess live happily ever after, the kingdom where peace is restored, the castle where the hero is crowned as the new ruler). The villain is punished (e.g., banished from the kingdom), and the hero is rewarded (e.g., marriage, wealth, or power).

The tale should be written in ${narrative_perspective} (e.g., first-person/third person) with a ${tone} (e.g., adventurous, magical) tone, aiming to teach the ${lesson} (e.g., bravery and kindness always triumph over evil, the importance of loyalty and friendship, the power of wisdom over strength)."""
